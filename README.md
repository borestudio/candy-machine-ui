Candy Machine User Interface Configuration Guide
Introduction
This guide offers a detailed step-by-step process for setting up the user interface (UI) of a Candy Machine. The UI is designed for NFT minting utilizing a specific SPL token. Users will conduct the minting process through their Phantom wallets.

Before You Start
Before starting, make sure you have:

Configured your Candy Machine with necessary details in the config.json file (price, quantity, symbol, seller fee basis points, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details).
A Phantom wallet set up for minting.
A newly created SPL token.
Procedure
1. Setting Up the SPL Token
Firstly, create the SPL token following the instructions in Lesson Three. Remember the SPL token's address.

2. Configuring the Candy Machine
Modify the config.json file of your Candy Machine. Update these fields:

splTokenAccount: Change this to the address of your newly created SPL token account.
splToken: Change this to the address of the SPL token.
3. Setting Up the User Interface
Follow the instructions in the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial to develop a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI will enable users to connect their Phantom wallets and use the SPL token for minting NFTs.

4. Modifying the Minting Logic
Alter the minting logic in your SPL project (as discussed in Lesson Three) to either mint NFTs directly to the Phantom wallet address or change the transfer function to send minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. Conducting Tests
Test the entire setup comprehensively. Transfer or mint your SPL token to a Phantom account and use the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring the process is smooth and functional for users paying with the SPL token.
